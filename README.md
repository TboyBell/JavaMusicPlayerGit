# JavaMusicPlayerGit
A basic MusicPlayer made on JavaFx.

I Tried to keep this project as simple as possible,
achieving most of the basics( Play, Stop, And Display Music Availabe).

There are kinks to work out like the fact that once the music starts no other button is presseable,
functions like (Fast Forward and Loop).
and i belive i could create a function to choose music from your pc, usin the choosefileextension,
but ultimately i built this in only a day.
