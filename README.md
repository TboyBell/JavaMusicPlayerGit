# Java Music Player Application

## Overview
This Java Music Player application is my first full project. 

It features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for playing a list of predefined music files.

The application is built using Java Swing for the GUI components and Java Sound API for audio playback. 

It provides a user-friendly interface with a title, a music list, and controls to play the music.

## Features
- **GUI with Java Swing**: The application uses Java Swing to create a windowed interface, including buttons, labels, and lists.
- **Audio Playback**: It uses the Java Sound API to handle audio playback of .wav files.
- **Music List**: A predefined list of music files is displayed in the GUI, allowing users to see the available tracks.
- **Play Button**: A button to start playing the music files sequentially.
